# Accountant Zinaida Markovna is very afraid that her quarterly report will be ruined by hackers.
# She asked system administrator Pakhom to protect the file with a password.
# Pakhom loves the number 3 very much, so he generated a positive integer number with exactly three digits 3 as a password.
# Unfortunately, Zinaida Markovna lost the piece of paper with the password,
# and Pakhom only remembers that he was the ith number with exactly three triples.
# Help them open the file.

# Input format
# Given a positive integer i not exceeding 10000.

# Output format
# Print one integer â€” the password to the file.

# Sample
# Input	Output
# 1
# 333
